###  How to install Cracked Apps on iPhone & iPod Touch & iPad WITHOUT WiFi or itunes

As all cracked App Store apps have ".IPA" extension, so you must install first
'Installous' which can then be used to install the cracked IPA files. All you
need is a jailbroken iDevice. Since these are the jailbreaking tools that will
create a Root Folder on your iDevice.

* Download 'iPhone Explorer' for Mac and PC from:
  http://www.macroplant.com/iphoneexplorer/. You can also use'DiskAid' for Mac
  and PC from : http://www.digidna.net/products/diskaid/download
* Connect your iDevice to your Computer via USB and launch iPhone Explorer.
  Follow and Navigate exactly as shown in the video.
* Now you need to download a Cracked App. Download it from
  http://apptrackr.org/ You can also search on Google or http://4shared.com or
  anywhere you like.  Its your choice. But it MUST be in ".ipa" extension.
  Because this ".ipa" is the only extension that is recognized by our Apple
  Devices.
* Once you have the IPA file, launch DiskAid or iPhone Explorer. Go to
  **/var/mobile/Documents/Installous/Downloads** and place IPA file in
  'Downloads' directory exactly as shown in the video. Do not place it anywhere
  else.
* Open Installous on your iPhone or iPod Touch or iPad and go to its Download
  section. You will find your cracked app. Tap on it and hit Install. Done.
  Your Cracked app will now be installed successfully.
